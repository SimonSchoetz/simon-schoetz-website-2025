            Ride&apos;s growth to over 100,000 users by the time I left gave me
            a front-row seat to how rapid scaling transforms both a product and
            the team behind it. As technical depth and complexity outgrew the
            capacity of any single developer to know every detail, we adapted by
            splitting into specialized areas and finding new ways to collaborate
            on the bigger picture. Alongside my development work, I introduced
            and established Scrum practices as the team expanded, helping us
            stay aligned and focused through the challenges of scaling. I am
            proud of the improvements I contributed, from refining user flows to
            strengthening system reliability, and of the trust I earned to take
            on the most complex and irregular challenges.

            Fabucar was my baptism by fire into large-scale, production-level
            development. Coming straight out of a bootcamp, I started in
            familiar territory with the React Native app, but quickly adapted to
            unfamiliar technologies and a sprawling Python backend. It taught me
            how to navigate messy legacy code while still delivering value,
            balance feature development with performance improvements, and
            collaborate directly with an external client&apos;s technical team.
            While the complexity and constraints made it a challenging
            environment, the adaptability and resilience I developed there
            became the foundation for tackling more ambitious projects later in
            my career.
